# LM-Digitalization — Python OCR Pipeline for Bills of Materials

---

## Overview
End-to-end Python pipeline designed to digitize scanned Bills of Materials (LM) and convert them into structured, standardized Excel files.  
The system combines OCR, rule-based parsing, and automated Excel generation to replace slow and error-prone manual transcription workflows.

---

## Pipeline Architecture
The pipeline is composed of two coordinated modules:

- **PY-MP-008 — Digitalización Inicial LM**  
  OCR extraction and structuring of scanned PDFs into intermediate datasets.

- **PY-MP-005 — Postprocesamiento LM**  
  Automated generation of standardized M-XXXXX Excel files from structured OCR output.

## Impact
- Reduced LM processing time by ~67%.
- Enabled scalable digitization of ~2,300 scanned pages.
- Eliminated transcription errors and inconsistent formatting.
